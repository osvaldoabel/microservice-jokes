**Complete Microservice Application Using - GO**

This Repo contains just a simple implementation of microservice architecture, without any external tool (using only golang) to do everything.
- Service Discovery - in GO
- Service Registry - GO
- Gradeing MiocroService - GO 
- Logs Microservice - GO

**NOTE 1**:  
  The goal (and the fun part) of the project is to reproduce a this architecture model and let it work properly with all necessary ms components, like *Message queue system*, *Authentication*, *log*, etc. only using golang, no external tool, no robust library, no RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka, Keyclok, etc. ONLY GOLANG.


**NOTE 2**:  
- No docs yet. I'll start document it properly when It'll be in a functional version.   
- It's Just for fun & study purpose!

TO DO
- Monitoring:
- Auth
- Message Queue System 
- etc.
