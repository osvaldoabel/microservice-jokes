This Repo contains just a simple implementation of microservice architecture, without any external tool (using only golang) to do every thing.
- Service Discovery - in GO
- Service Registry - GO
- Gradeing MiocroService - GO 
- Logs Microservice - GO

**NOTE 1**:  
  The goal (and the funny side) of the project is to reproduce a this architecture model and let it work properly with all necessary ms components, like *Message queue system*, *Authentication*, *log*, etc. only using golang, no external tool, no robust library, no RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka, Keyclok, etc. ONLY GOLANG.


**NOTE 2**:  
No docs yet. It's *JUST FOR FUN & study purpose!*

TO DO
- Monitoring:
- Auth
- Message Queue System 
- etc.
